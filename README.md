# Email Spam Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on building an email spam detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify incoming emails as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam) with high accuracy. This README provides an overview of the project, including the methodologies used, how to set up and run the code, and the results obtained.

## Features

* **Email Classification:** Accurately classifies emails as spam or ham.
* **Text Preprocessing:** Handles cleaning and preparing raw email text for analysis.
* **Feature Extraction:** Converts text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
* **Model Training & Evaluation:** Demonstrates training and evaluating various classification models.
* **Performance Metrics:** Reports standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset of SMS messages (commonly used as a proxy for short emails in many academic and open-source projects due to similar characteristics in text classification). The dataset typically contains two columns: one for the label (`spam`/`ham`) and another for the message content.

* **Source:** [Mention your dataset source here, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository. If it's included in the repository, state that.]
* **Format:** CSV or similar text-based format.
* **Example Data (Illustrative):**
    ```
    ham,Go until jurong point, crazy.. Available only in bugis n great world la e buffet...
    ham,Ok lar... Joking wif u oni...
    spam,Free entry in 2 a wkly comp to win FA Cup final tkts 21st May 2005. Text FA to 87121 to receive entry question(STD apply)T&C's apply 08452810075
    ```

## Methodology

The core of this spam detection system involves several key steps:

### Text Preprocessing

Before training any model, the raw email text undergoes several preprocessing steps to standardize and clean the data:

* **Lowercasing:** Converts all text to lowercase to treat words like "Free" and "free" as the same.
* **Punctuation Removal:** Eliminates punctuation marks that do not contribute to classification.
* **Stop Word Removal:** Removes common words (e.g., "the," "is," "a") that carry little semantic meaning.
* **Stemming/Lemmatization (Optional but Recommended):** Reduces words to their base form (e.g., "running," "runs," "ran" to "run").

### Feature Extraction

After preprocessing, the textual data needs to be converted into numerical features that machine learning models can understand. Common techniques include:

* **Bag-of-Words (BoW):** Represents text as an unordered collection of words, with each word's frequency being a feature.
* **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** Assigns weights to words based on their frequency in a document and their rarity across the entire dataset, giving more importance to unique and significant words.

### Classification Algorithms

This project explores various classification algorithms to determine the best performing model for spam detection.

#### Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a statistical model used for binary classification. Despite its name, it's a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm. It models the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., spam or ham) using a logistic function.

* **How it works:** Logistic Regression calculates a weighted sum of the input features and passes it through a sigmoid (logistic) function to output a probability score between 0 and 1. If this probability is above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.5), it's classified as one class; otherwise, it's the other.
* **Why it's suitable for spam detection:** It's a simple yet powerful algorithm, computationally efficient, and provides interpretable probabilities, making it a good baseline for text classification tasks like spam detection. It can effectively learn the relationship between features (word occurrences/TF-IDF scores) and the likelihood of an email being spam.

#### Other Classification Algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM)

While Logistic Regression is a primary focus, the project might also evaluate other algorithms for comparison:

* **Naive Bayes:** Particularly suited for text classification due to its assumption of feature independence (which simplifies calculations for high-dimensional text data).
* **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Effective in high-dimensional spaces and for cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/email-spam-detection.git](https://github.com/your-username/email-spam-detection.git)
    cd email-spam-detection
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your repository containing: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, etc.)

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the spam detection script:

1.  **Prepare your dataset:** Ensure your dataset file (e.g., `spam_sms_dataset.csv`) is in the `data/` directory or specified correctly in the code.

2.  **Run the main script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    (Replace `main.py` with the actual name of your primary script, e.g., `spam_detector.py` or `train_model.py`)

    The script will typically:
    * Load the dataset.
    * Perform preprocessing and feature extraction.
    * Train the chosen machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression).
    * Evaluate the model's performance.
    * (Optional) Save the trained model for future use.

3.  **To test a custom email (if implemented):**
    ```bash
    python predict.py "Enter your email message here."
    ```
    (Adjust script name as needed)

## Results

The performance of the models will be evaluated using standard classification metrics. Here's an example of how results might be presented:

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| :------------------- | :------- | :-------- | :----- | :------- |
| **Logistic Regression** | 0.98     | 0.95      | 0.92   | 0.93     |
| Naive Bayes          | 0.97     | 0.90      | 0.96   | 0.93     |
| SVM                  | 0.98     | 0.96      | 0.90   | 0.93     |

*Note: These are illustrative results. Actual performance may vary based on the dataset and model hyperparameters.*

A confusion matrix might also be displayed to show true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
